# Swordmaster's Youngest Son MTL corrector
### I'm fed up of MTL horrible translations so I made a script that replace all the name with the Web Comic translation's ones
## TODO:
- [ ] Translate notes from Italian to English
- [ ] Keep updating the "dictionary"
- [ ] Create a simple, in terminal, interface so that IDE won't be required
- [X] Insulting everything bc code doesn't work 


# Guide for installing
## NOTE: Python is needed for this script to run
- [ ] Click the green button "Code" --> "Dowload ZIP"
- [ ] Extract the files
- [ ] Open them in your favorite IDE (make sure the files are all in the same directory)
- [ ] Open a terminal in your IDE and copy-paste this: python -m venv .venv
- [ ] Now write: pip install docx2txt
- [ ] Replace the placeholders for the path and you are good to go
